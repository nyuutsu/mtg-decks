"EDH - Wrexial - College" is a snapshot of a deck I had in paper many years ago before I had access to a real cardpool & could only get something by trading for it among friends
`
"EDH - Zetalpa - Mean" & "EDH - Zetalpa - Nice" are intended to allow trying to make some interestind decisions against a typical playgroup w/o being oppressive
`
"EDH - Reki" is designed to drown the opponent in card advantage --> figure out a way to make lots of mana --> use any of a few routes to produce, buff, hasten board, swing lethal,  & have it be non-obvious which turns are attempted kill turns

"EDH - Meren - Karen" this is a deck I designed for acn/aria's karen/kirie based on her preferences ("some bullshit coming out of the graveyard").
