"EDH - Wrexial - College" is a snapshot of a deck I had in paper many years ago before I had access to a real cardpool & could only get something by trading for it among friends

"EDH - Zetalpa - Mean" & "EDH - Zetalpa - Nice" are the decks in active development. Both are designed to allow themselves to be played optimalishly against a typical playgroup and not put a bad taste in anyone's mouth.

"EDH - Reki" is designed to drown the opponent in card advantage --> figure out a way to make lots of mana --> use any of a few routes to produce, buff, hasten board, swing lethal,  & have it be non-obvious which turns are attempted kill turns

"EDH - Meren - Karen" this is a deck I designed for acn/aria's karen/kirie based on her preferences ("some bullshit coming out of the graveyard"). I'd be happy to make one for you. Will need to play more games and find aha moment of "I really liked doing that", or "I really like this card", first.
